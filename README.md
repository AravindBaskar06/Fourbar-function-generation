# Fourbar-function-generation
Mathematica and Bertini codes to design four-bars for a desired coordination function. A polynomial optimization problem is solved using Bertini, a numerical continuation solver, to thoroughly characterize the design space of four-bars for any given function to be coordinated. A graph of the candidate designs found is presented to the user which can be navigated in an interactive manner to pick a candidate after evaluating for auxiliary design considerations.
